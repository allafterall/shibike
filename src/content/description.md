Hi,
I'm Anna, a documentary director with a passion for social issues and LGBTQ+ stories. Over the past four years, I've had the amazing opportunity to develop the YouTube channel "Straight talk with gay people by Karen Shainyan." It's been an incredible journey to create a space where we can talk openly about LGBTQ+ life in Russia. I'm proud to say we've connected with over 200,000 subscribers and have had some really eye-opening conversations with some inspiring people along the way.

## Projects

### Queerography

Anna broadened her impact with ‚ÄúQueerography‚Äù [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6dean6qJHM) (English subtitles) the first documentary series dedicated to the queer community's experience across Russia: thousands of kilometres from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok. The series sheds light on the queer life amidst legal and societal challenges.

### Skazhi Gordeevoi (Tell Gordeeva)

Collaborating with Katerina Gordeeva [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/skazhigordeevoy/featured), Anna co-created the project ‚ÄúSkazhi Gordeevoi‚Äù for Russian independent media outlet Meduza.io. Serving as the director and DOP, Anna has been producing the very first 20 episodes that delve into a variety of compelling stories and voices forming the concept that has been thriving till today.
