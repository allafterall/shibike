          Hi, my name is Andrey. I used to work as a software engineer, but over time I realized I get much more satisfaction from working with real, tangible things. 
          As a passionate cyclist, bike servicing turned out to be the perfect fit. I love the process of bringing bikes back to their best.</p>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs incredibly rewarding for me to see how much of a difference a well-tuned bike can make to someone's ride.
